Our formulas are specially designed for active women, using the power of nature to remove sweat, balance moisture, and help you transition from your workout to whatever’s next. A 1-hour workout is only 4% of the day — but for many women, breaking a sweat means sacrificing beauty and personal style in the other 96%. Whether you go from deadlifts to date night, happy hour after a HIIT workout, or running miles between meetings, SUNDAY II SUNDAY has you covered with products that celebrate your active lifestyle and help you bounce back.   For our founder Keenan Beasley, it’s not either or; it’s both. Inspired by the active women in his family and a passion for solving problems, Keenan built the first and only haircare brand dedicated to women who sweat.

Once the workout is done, sweat has done its job and it’s time to remove sweat from our scalp. Post-workout, sweat and our natural scalp oils combine. This combination causes our scalp to lose moisture and experience acidity (pH) changes. When this combo trickles down to our hair strands our hair can become dry, brittle, and frizzy because our hair shaft swells and our hair cuticles open. We can remove this sweat, scalp oil combo with a wash, but sometimes there just isn’t time for a full wash day. Meet  , the haircare line for active women that cares for your hair and scalp pre, post, and during your workout. Once you're done with your sweat session give   a good shake and apply it to your scalp to rid your scalp of post workout sweat. This sweet smelling combination of apple cider vinegar and micellar water clears dirt and sweat from the scalp, balances your scalp’s pH, and neutralizes odor causing bacteria. No more funny smelling gym hair or sweaty scalp. Need a targeted scalp treatment during your recovery days? Get a healthier scalp in 28 days with   Daily Scalp Serum.

Now that you’ve gently cleansed, it’s time to moisturize your hair and get your style back with  . It coats the hair strands with natural botanical extracts and antioxidants to restore moisture lost due to sweat. A few sprays will refresh curls, reduce frizz, and restore shine so you can go about your post-workout day with your hair just the way you like. Hair on the edges of your scalp is the most fragile.

Protect those edges by applying   to your hairline prior to your headband or hat.
