Once the workout is done, sweat has done its job and it\u2019s time to remove sweat from our scalp. Post-workout, sweat and our natural scalp oils combine. This combination causes our scalp to lose moisture and experience acidity (pH) changes. When this combo trickles down to our hair strands our hair can become dry, brittle, and frizzy because our hair shaft swells and our hair cuticles open. We can remove this sweat, scalp oil combo with a wash, but sometimes there just isn\u2019t time for a full wash day. Meet  , the haircare line for active women that cares for your hair and scalp pre, post, and during your workout. Once you're done with your sweat session give   a good shake and apply it to your scalp to rid your scalp of post workout sweat. This sweet smelling combination of apple cider vinegar and micellar water clears dirt and sweat from the scalp, balances your scalp\u2019s pH, and neutralizes odor causing bacteria.
